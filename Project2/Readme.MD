### Statistic of BS and Ph.D. in Physics from 1966 to 2020

## Motivation

This project is from my personal interest. I am curious to find out how many college students earn a degree in physics. These days, most students wants to be engineers rather than scientists in academia. 
I am also curious on how many students with BS degreeâ€™s in physics continue their study to obtain a doctorate degree in physics. I will not only look at the number of physics students with a BS and Ph.D. degree, but also look into the statistics of female vs male students in physics to get more insights on the gender gap in the field. I will try my best to visualize the data as clear as possible.

## Discussion

First, I want to compare the numbers of students in three different majors -engineering, computer science, and physics- from 1966 to 2022. The plot is shown below.
