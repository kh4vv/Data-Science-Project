# Do College Students Actually Study Physics in These Days?

### Statistic of BS and Ph.D. in Physics from 1966 to 2020

## Motivation

This project is from my personal interest. I am curious to find out how many college students earn a degree in physics. These days, most students wants to be engineers rather than scientists in academia. 
I am also curious on how many students with BS degreeâ€™s in physics continue their study to obtain a doctorate degree in physics. I will not only look at the number of physics students with a BS and Ph.D. degree, but also look into the statistics of female vs male students in physics to get more insights on the gender gap in the field. I will try my best to visualize the data as clear as possible.

## Discussion

First, I want to compare numbers of students in three different majors -engineering, computer science, and physics- from 1966 to 2022. The plot is shown below.

From the plot, as we all expected, a number of students increases in all three majors over the years. However, I am surprised when I compared how many students in three majors increases from 1966 to 2022. Numbers of students in Engineering major increases from 35,826 to 130,063, which is **94,237**. Numbers of students in Computer Science major increases from 0 to 101,570, which is **101,570**. However, numbers of students in Physics major increases from 4,608 to 9,457, which is **ONLY 4,849**.   

However this graph does not show the *true trends* because there are different numbers of students in colleges in each year. In order to evaluate the actual trends, the ratio of numbers of students in each major to total numbers of students in all major for each year from 1966 to 2022 is needed to be calculated. The plot is shown below.

The result is actually shocked. The percentage of students in Engineering major actually drops from 6.84% in 1966 to 6.01% in 2020. However, looking at the trend, both percentages of students in Engineering and Computer Science keep increasing since 2010 without losing any momentums. I can predict that the percentage of students in Engineering will catch up 6.84% and it will go beyond in near future. However, looking at the Physics trend, I cannot find any hope. In 2022, students in Physics major are not even 0.5 % of total students and I do not find any statsical reasons that the percentage of students in Physics major will not pass 0.5% in future. 

Now let's look at numbers of female students in three majors. What do you expect to see on the graph? Here is the graph below.
