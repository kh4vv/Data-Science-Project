# Do College Students Actually Study Physics in These Days?

### Statistic of BS and Ph.D. in Physics from 1966 to 2020

## Motivation

This project is from my personal interest. I always wonder how many students in colleges earn a degree in physics. 
These days, most of students want to be engineers rather than scientists in academia. 
I am also curious how many students with BS degree in physics actually decide to study more physics and continue thier paths to the doctorate degree in physics. 
Not only numbers of students in BS and Ph.D. in physics, but also I look into statistics of female students in physics to get more insights by gender.
I will try my best to visualize the data as clear as possible.
