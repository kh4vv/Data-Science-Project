# Do College Students Actually Study Physics These Days?

### Statistic of BS and Ph.D. in Physics from 1966 to 2020

## Motivation

This project is from my personal interest. I am curious to find out how many college students earn a degree in physics. These days, most students wants to be engineers rather than scientists in academia. 
I am also curious on how many students with BS degree’s in physics continue their study to obtain a doctorate degree in physics. I will not only look at the number of physics students with a BS and Ph.D. degree, but also look into the statistics of female vs male students in physics to get more insights on the gender gap in the field. I will try my best to visualize the data as clear as possible.

## Discussion

First, I want to compare the numbers of students in three different majors -engineering, computer science, and physics- from 1966 to 2022. The plot is shown below.

</p>

From the plot, as we all expected, the number of students increases in all three majors over the years. However, I am surprised when I compared how many students in three majors increases from 1966 to 2022. The number of students in Engineering majors increases from 35,826 to 130,063, which is **94,237**. Number of students in Computer Science major increases from 0 to 101,570, which is **101,570**. However, the number of students in Physics major increased from 4,608 to 9,457, which is **ONLY 4,849**.   

However, this graph does not show the *true trends* because there are different numbers of students in colleges each year. In order to evaluate the actual trends, the ratio of the number of students in each major to the total number of students in all majors for each year from 1966 to 2022 is needed to be calculated. The plot is shown below.

</p>

The result is actually shocking. The percentage of students in Engineering majors actually dropped from 6.84% in 1966 to 6.01% in 2020. However, looking at the trend, both percentages of students in Engineering and Computer Science keep increasing since 2010 without losing any momentums. I can predict that the percentage of students in Engineering will catch up by 6.84% and it will go beyond in the near future. However, looking at the Physics trend, I cannot find any hope. In 2022, students in Physics major are not even 0.5 % of total students and I do not find any statistical reasons that the percentage of students in Physics major will not pass 0.5% in the future. 

Now let's look at the number of female students in three majors. What do you expect to see on the graph? Here is the graph below.

</p>

What a surprise! I did not expect these trends at all. The female ratio is the highest in Physics major among the three majors. This is bright news for the Physics world. The graph shows that more and more female students are majoring in science and engineering (including Computer Science) and I predict the female ratios will keep increasing in the future.

As I had my doctorate degree in Physics, I am curious how many Physics major students go to Ph.D. after graduating from college. My expectation is that most of the students in Physics would continue their academic career to Ph.D. in physics. Let's look at the plots.

<p align="center">

</p>

There are three plots. The top plot shows how many students in Physics earn BS and Ph.D. degrees. The number of students in BS physics is from 4,608 to 9,457, which is **105 %** increment. On the other hand, the number of students in Ph.D. is from 1013 to 1905, which is only **88 %** increment. However, in order to know what proportion of students from BS actually go to Ph.D., we have to look at the ratio shown in the sidebar plot. The result of the ratios from 1966 to 2020 is **27.92 % +/- 0.59 %**. The most students who went to PhD was in 1997 with a ratio of 39.21 %. But since then, we can see the number of students who go to Ph.D. decreased and the ratio was only **20.14 %** in 2020. I will predict a downhill trend in the future and will be less than a 20 % ratio soon. The middle plot is the scatter plot from BS and Ph.D. numbers of students from 1966 to 2020. The correlation is 0.88 - two data are highly correlated. 

Finally, since we already looked at the female ratio in BS Physics, I am curious about the female ratio in Ph.D. Physics. The plot is below.

</p>

Total male students in Ph.D. over the years do not really increase much. The plot has repeatable patterns of up and down and now is downhill. However, the number of female students in Ph.D. Physics keeps increasing. Because of this phenomenon, the female ratio in PhD Physics increases dramatically about 5 times from 1966 to 2020. 

## Conclusion

These days, most of the college students that I met are studying computer science or engineering majors, especially biology-related majors. I felt like students choose their majors such that they are able to secure their jobs in the future. Physics, however, is one of the least popular majors in colleges and only less than 0.5 % of students are actually in the Physics department. The good news is that the female ratio keeps higher and higher as time goes but the absolute student size is still very small. Studying Physics is a key to understanding the fundamentals of matters in the universe. In order to explore and expand our knowledge of science, technology, and the universe, we should try to find a way to support and provide more opportunities in the future to appeal to college students to study physics. Otherwise, the number of students in physics will keep decreasing.
